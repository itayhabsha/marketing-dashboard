Project Title: Smart Campaign Decisions Dashboard

Interactive Dashboard Link: https://marketing-dashboard-reasonlabs.streamlit.app/

As part of this project, we developed an interactive Streamlit dashboard to support ReasonLabs marketing decision-making process in environments characterized by high uncertainty and sparse data. The dashboard integrates Bayesian inference techniques with machine learning models (Random Forest) to analyze digital marketing campaigns. It enables real-time analysis, probabilistic comparisons across campaigns, and financial KPI tracking such as CAC, ROI, and LTV ultimately aiming to optimize budget allocation and increase campaign effectiveness.
